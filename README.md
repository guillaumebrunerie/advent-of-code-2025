# Advent of code 2025

This is my code for the Advent of code 2025, my goal is to not only solve the
puzzles, but to also make a visualization for every day, all in a similar style
(more artistic than pedagogic), which can then be combined into a final video.

You can check the visualizations that I have made so far at
